# Tax Compliance Attitudes in Kenya and Uganda: Evidence From Matching Methods Using Survey Data (Replication Files)
### Twaweza-LSE Capstone Project 2022


This report investigates the causes of citizensâ€™ attitudes towards voluntary tax compliance in Kenya and Uganda. Using Twaweza survey data collected in 2021, we applied a statistical technique known as Coarsened Exact Matching (CEM) to implement a causal inference procedure aiming to answer the following question:

*What are the major causes of attitudes towards voluntary tax compliance in Kenya and Uganda?*

The Ugandan and Kenyan data analysis files can be found within the respective folders. Each data analysis file should replicate the analysis and findings from our report. A copy of this report is available on request.
